# Braintrust SDK Installation (Agent Instructions)

## Hard Rules

- **Interactive mode:** You can ask the user questions through the chat interface.


- **Only add Braintrust code.** Do not refactor or modify unrelated code.
- **Pin exact versions.** Never use `latest`.
- **Set the project name in code.** Do NOT configure project name via env vars.
- **App must run without Braintrust.** If `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` is missing at runtime, do not crash.
- **Abort install if API key is not set.** (Do not modify runtime behavior.)
- **Do not guess APIs.** Use official documentation/examples only.
- **Do not add eval code** unless explicitly requested.
- **Do not add manual flush/shutdown logic.**
- **If SDK is already installed/configured, do not duplicate work.**

## Execution Requirements

Before writing any code:

1. Create a **checklist** from the steps below.
2. Execute each step in order.
3. Do not skip steps.

---

## Steps

### 1. Verify API Key (Install Precondition)

Check if `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` is exported:

```bash
if env | grep 'BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=' >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then echo "api key set" ; else echo "api key NOT set"; fi
```

If not set, **abort installation immediately**.

---

### 2. Language

The target language has been specified: **TypeScript**.

---

### 3. Install SDK

Read the install guide from the local docs: `C:\Users\medya\Desktop\ai-engineering-fundamentals\.bt\skills\docs\sdk-install/typescript.md`

Requirements:

- Pin an exact SDK version (resolve via package manager).
- Modify only dependency files and a minimal application entry point (e.g., main/bootstrap). Auto-instrument the app (except for Java and C# which don't support auto-instrumentation).
- Do not change unrelated code.

---

### 4. Verify Installation (MANDATORY)

- Run the application.
- Confirm at least one log/trace is emitted to Braintrust.
- Confirm no runtime errors.
- Confirm the app still runs if `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` is unset.

If you do not know how to run the app, ask the user and wait for the response before proceeding.

### 5. Verify in Braintrust (CRITICAL)

The permalink must be included in the final output. This confirms the full installation succeeded.

The project name is the project field of `bt status --json`. The project must be set in code during installation — do not guess the project name from context.

**How to obtain the permalink:**

Most language SDKs print a direct URL to the emitted trace after the app runs. Capture that URL and print it.

If the SDK does not print a URL, construct one manually using the URL format documented in `C:\Users\medya\Desktop\ai-engineering-fundamentals\.bt\skills\docs\sdk-install/braintrust-url-formats.md`:

---

### 6. Final Summary

Summarize:

- What SDK version was installed
- Where code was modified
- What logs/traces were emitted
- The Braintrust permalink (required)

---

### 7. Next Steps

Tell the user:

- Braintrust agent skills have been installed and are available to your coding agent to help you integrate Braintrust into your product.
- The Braintrust MCP server can be added to make your coding agent even more helpful when working with Braintrust — run `bt setup mcp` to install it. More information at https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/integrations/developer-tools/mcp

## Agent Skills

Use the installed Braintrust agent skills from `.agents/skills/braintrust/`. When verifying data in Braintrust, prefer local `bt` CLI commands over direct API calls. Do not rely on the Braintrust MCP server for data queries.
